                <p>Transitioning from a career in the US Air Force, I'm concurrently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science with a focus on machine learning and AI from Tulane. Meanwhile, I work as a Combined Space Operations Subject Matter Expert for Booz Allen Hamilton. My professional journey spans Software, Web, and Video Game Development, driven by a profound passion for programming and technology.</p>
                
                
                <p>I began with a Magnet Program in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering, followed by the United States Air Force Academy. There, I instructed in unpowered flight and operated FALCON SAT satellites, laying the foundation for my technical expertise.</p>

               
                <p>Alongside my academic pursuits, I'm delving into software and web development, utilizing my programming skills to create immersive experiences across various platforms. Additionally, I'm exploring video game development, aiming to innovate and craft captivating gaming experiences.</p>

                
                <p>My tenure in the Air Force honed leadership, organization, and project management skills, alongside a commitment to diversity and mentorship. I now apply these skills in my role as a Subject Matter Expert at Booz Allen Hamilton.</p>

                
                <p>While I may not be a seasoned programmer, I'm dedicated to continuous learning and growth in the field. Beyond coding, I enjoy motorcycle camping and immersing myself in diverse cultures, enriching my perspective and creativity.</p>

                <p>Excited to contribute my diverse skill set to the tech industry, I'm passionate about driving innovation and excellence in every project I undertake.</p>
